# Visualization of UV‑maps for Polygonal Meshes as a 3D Morphing

This project was developed as part of a master’s thesis in Computer Science at the University of Milan.

It focuses on enhancing the visualization of UV maps for 3D meshes, with the goal of improving understanding of the relationship between a 3D model's geometry and its corresponding 2D texture representation. Through the implementation of morphing techniques, the project makes the transformation from 3D to 2D easier to follow, illustrating the unwrapping process in a clear and interactive way.

The intended uses of this project range from visual qualitative assessments of UV-map quality to illustrative purposes, including use in educational contexts.
